        "- Shartest path problems: finding a [ath between two vertices in a graph such that the sum of weights of its edges is minimized\n",
        "- Dijkstra algoritm\n",
        "    - It was constructed by computer scientist Edsgar Dijkstra in 1956\n",
        "    - Djikstra can handle positive edge weights / Bellman-Ford algorithm can have negative weights as well\n",
        "    - Several variants: it can find the shortest path from A to B, but it is able to construct a shortest path tree as well -> defines the shortest paths from a source to all other nodes\n",
        "    - This is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights\n",
        "    - Dijkstras algorithm time complexity: O(V*logV+E)\n",
        "    - Dijkstras algorithm is a greedy one: it tries to find the global optimum with the help of local minimum -> it turns out to be good\n",
        "    - It is greedy -> on every iteration we want to find the minimum distance to the next vertext possible -> appropriate data structures: heaps(binary or Fibonacci) or in general a priority queue\n",
        "    - Does not work with negative edge weights.\n",
        "    - Uses Priority queue (Heap)\n",
        "    - Without priority queue (Heap) the time complexity is O(V*V+E)\n",
        "- Bellman-Ford algorithm\n",
        "    - Invented in 1958 by Bellman and Ford independently\n",
        "    - Slower than Dijkstras but more robust: it can handle negative edge weights too\n",
        "    - Dijkstra algorithm chooses the edges greedily, with the lowest cost: Bellman-Ford relaxes all edges at the same time for V-1 iteration\n",
        "    - Running time is O(V*E) Linear Time Complexity\n",
        "    - Does V-1 iteration +1 to detect cycles: if cost decreases in the V-th iteration, that there is a negative cycle, beacause all the paths are traversen up to the V-1 iteration\n",
        "    - Yen Algorithm (1970): It is the Bellman-Ford algorithm with some potimization\n",
        "        - We can terminate the algoritm if there is no change in the distances between two iterations\n",
        "        - It uses the same technique as bubble sort\n",
        "    - Application:\n",
        "        - Cycle detection can prove to be very important\n",
        "        - Negative cycles as well -> we have to run the Bellman-Ford algoritm that can handle negative edge weights by default\n",
        "        - On the FOREX market it can detect arbitrage situations\n",
        "    - Additional/final iterations are needed so the algorithm can check whether any negative cycles are in the graph or not\n",

        "- Strings, characters -> alphabetical ordering\n",
        "- Comparison based algorithms\n",
        "    - bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort\n",
        "- Non-comparison based sorting\n",
        "    - radix sort, bucket sort\n",
        "- Features\n",
        "    - Time complexity O(N^2), O(N log N), O(N)\n",
        "    - In place: Strictly an in-place sort needs only O(1) memory beyond the items being sorted\n",
        "        - So an in-place algorithm does not need any extra memory\n",
        "    - Recursive: some sorting algorithms are implemented in a recursive manner -> the divide and conquer ones especially (merge sort(stable) and quick sort(unstable))\n",
        "    - Stable: Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal values\n",
        "\n",
        "## Adaptive Sorting Algorithms\n",
        "- An adaptive algorithm is an algorithm that changes its behavior based on information available at runtime\n",
        "- Adaptive sort -> it takes advantage of existing order in its input\n",
        "- It benefits from local orders -> sometimes an unsorted array contains sequences that are sorted by default -> the algorithm will sort faster\n",
        "- Most of the times: we just have to modify existing sorting algorithms in order to end up with an adaptive one\n",
        "- Comparison based algorithms have optimal O(N log N) running time complexity\n",
        "- Adaptive sort takes advantage of the existing order of the input to try to achieve better times: maybe O(N) could be reached\n",
        "- The more presorted the input is, the faster it should be sorted\n",
        "- IMPORTANT: nearly sorted sequences are common in practice\n",
        "- Heapsort, merge sort: not adaptive algorithms, the do not take advantage of presorted sequences\n",
        "- SHell sort: adaptive algorithm so performs better if the input is partially sorted\n",

        "- Not a stable sort -> does not preserve the order of keys with equal values\n",
        "- Almost always outperforms bubble sort\n",
        "- Quite counter intuitive: selection sort and insertion sort are both typically faster for small arrays (arrays with 10-20 items)\n",
        "- Usual optimization method -> recursive algorithms switch to insertion sort or selection sort for small subarrays\n",
        "- Makes less writes than insertion sort -> this can be important if writes are significantly more expensive than reads\n",
        "- For example with EEPROM or flash memory where every write lessens the lifespan of the memory\n",

        "- It is an online algorithm -> it can sort an array as it recieves it for example downloading data from the web\n",
        "- Hybrid algorithms uses insertion sort if the subarray is small enough\n",
        "    - Insertion sort is faster for small subarrays than quicksort\n",
        "- Variant of insertion sort is shell sort\n",
        "- Sometimes selection sort is better: they are very similar algorithms\n",
        "- Insertion sort requires more writes because the inner loop can require shifting large sections of the sorted portion of the array\n",
        "- In general, insertion sort wil lwrite to the array O(n^2) times while selection sort will write only O(n) times\n",
        "-For this reason selection sort may be preferable in cases where writing to memory is significantly more expensive than reading -> for example flash memory.\n",

        "- But the worst case running time is quadratic O(N^2)\n",

        "    - Primitive Types -> usually quicksort is used\n",

        "- Efficient quicksort implementations generally outperforms mergesort\n",
        "- Mergesort is often the best choice for sorting a linked list: in this situation it is relatively easy to implement a merge sort in such a way that it requires only o(1) extra space\n",
