# BUSINESS QUESTION

Please choose only ONE or TWO aspects of the business questions to analyze, as you have limitations on the number of slides and presentation time!

## Client Services: 

Q: Is there any relationship between the amount of time spent working with individual clients (time to complete an assessment, time to complete resume, number of logged activities, etc.) and how quickly they are employed?
 
Q: Is there a relationship between a client's demographic profile (rank, branch, time in service, spouse status etc.) and when that client registers for services?
 
Q: Is there a relationship between a client's demographic profile (rank, branch, time in service, spouse status etc.) and a client's likelihood to complete a survey?  
 
Q: Is there a way to tell what communication method (call, texting or email) is more successful with clients, either based on their success in job placement or some other outcome? 

- What about with regards to completed Volunteer Requests?

Q: Is there anything in the client's demographic profile that indicates that a client is more likely to become a confirmed hire or any other outcome?
 
Context: All of our contact records have Created Dates signifying when they first entered into the Hire Heroes USA system, but all clients have a Client Type and Client Category. These individuals are also identified with the Client field. Client Types of Online Registrant, Onward to Opportunity, and AVR are considered part of our PaCT program. Nearly all of these clients registered through one of our registration portals. AVRs (Attempted Veteran Registrants) were not selected for assignment and were sent messaging encouraging them to register again. If selected, they then become Online Registrants. Thus, Client Type just denotes a current status. Current (and former) AVRs are identified by the AVR field.
 
## Volunteer Program
 
Q:  What can we prove - quantitatively - that our volunteers are increasing the overall effectiveness of our program?   

- Does working with a volunteer raise the probability of a client getting hired or getting hire sooner? 
- Are there certain Mentoring activities that are more effective than others (based on Requested Support field)? 
- Do volunteer activities increase the quality of job obtained - like the salary level? 

Q: Do post-hire requests have any different results related to the above questions?
 
Q: Do multiple hires have a higher degree of participation in volunteer mentoring?
 
Context: For program evaluation, our Volunteer Program usually queries reports as follows: "Working with a volunteer" is defined as

- Mentoring request closed as Completed as compared to clients who have no volunteer program (Mentoring) requests
- Request Record Type = Volunteer Program Request
- Request Reason = Mentoring
- Request Status = Completed
- And for #2, Post-Hire Request? = True 

## Development
 
Q: Is there a geographic location within the US that most of our individual donors come from? Are there areas in the country we don't see any donors from? Do our social media posts or fundraisers calling for donations hit these areas with little to no donors? 
 
Q: Do we have an average lifespan of a monthly donor? 

- Do our monthly donors give for a year and then lapse, or do they give over the course of a few years? 
- Do our monthly donors who give more than one year increase their gift amount year over year?

Q: What frequency do we see unsolicited (non-event or fundraiser) donors month to month? 

-Do these donors give more than once a year? 
-What is the average gift of an unsolicited individual donor?

Context: Though all donations are updated in Salesforce, individual donations are done through a tool called Classy. Some donations are grouped as part of a campaign, while others are part of grants or corporate giving programs.
 
## Employer Partnerships and Opportunities
 
Q:  Do email campaigns have any effect on job seekers creating profiles on the Hire Heroes USA Job Board? 
 
Q: Is there a relationship between certain days of the week, times in the day, or months, or time of year and when employers and job seekers create accounts?
 
Context: Email campaigns are completed by using a software tool called Vertical Response. The data from this is included (as VREmailHistory), and anything identified as Top Jobs or Virtual Career Fair in Targeted Email Subject should be helpful here.
 
## Serving Spouses Program
 
Q: What is the average amount in days that a military spouse spends in the HHUSA program? 

- How does this differ from the average veteran client? 
- What is the demographic profile of the military spouses who are registering (gender, location, service members status, level of education?)  
- How does their Service Members status affect their time to hired status? (Note Service Members status is a new field we have just started tracking.)

 Q: Is there a correlation between education level and the black rate for military spouses. 

- What percentage of military spouse clients say that they are underemployed vs. unemployed? 
- How many spouses who registered for our services who say that they are underemployed turn blue vs grey? (Would like to see this data because military spouses tend to remain underemployed.)

 Q: Are a large percentage of military spouses who are overseas completing federal resume reviews? 

- How many of those clients accept federal employment? 
- How many spouses vs veterans are taking part in our volunteer services (career counseling, mock interviews, etc.)

Context: Our Serving Spouses program in a newer program from within Client Services. Through the Serving Spouses Program, new data will be collected for the purpose of better understanding our spouse clients and the unique employment challenges they face. This new data that will be collected by the Transition Specialists during Initial Assessments and will give HHUSA the power to analyze and improve the way the organization interacts with military spouse clients. With the ability to track and pull a range of reports, HHUSA can better understand its spouse clients by analyzing employment trends and identifying opportunities to better help spouse clients obtain meaningful employment.
